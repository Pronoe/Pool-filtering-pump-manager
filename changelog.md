    02/03/2022 : version 3.3 - adds heat pump automation (activates filtering pump when temperture below a threshold level to authorize heat pump activity)
                             - adds configuration commands through MQTT: heat pump temperature threshold, pump activation time, heat pump automation ON/OFF
                             - modify bootstrapper:parseQueueMsg to solve an issue with simple numeric values
                             - corrects bugs in new code for pump timing management
                             - migrates to bootstrapper library release 12.1.6 and corrects some remaining issues (such as DNS incorrect configuration with ESP32)
                             - watchdog timeout set to 180s to allow OTA uplaod

    26/03/2022 : version 3.6 - add permanent pump stop mode (for maintenance purpose)
                                note: the hardware has been installed in the pump cabinet on 29/03/2022 and successfully tested (high power pump contr√¥l, WiFi link, pump management)
    31/03/2022 : version 3.7 - add WiFi channel publishing (following an issue with channel switching of the gateway wich gave "beacon lost" detceted by the ESP32 )
    
    Done steps:
    - test temperature sensor acqusition and libraries - done
    - test relay board connection and activation - done
    - implements specific data structure - done
    - implement Mosquitto MQTT server on RPI3 and Home-Assistant application on RPI3 - done (IP 192.168.0.117)
    - implement MQTT management with bootstarp library (validated by coupling with home-assistant on 29/12/2021)
    - basic time information saving in flash memory
    - implement conversion from raw data in s to time in week, day, hour, mn, s through Home-assistant template in Configuration.yaml
    - test OTA update with Bootstrapper library (note: the OTA password entered in flash memory is asked before uploading)
    - implements ezTime library and uses it for local time management instead of UTC time
    - implements a stack of event with time tag and event number
    - saves in the event stack early event occuring during setup
    - remove all unused code from initial version
    - implements pump forced ON or OFF through Home-assistant buttons
    - implements redondant context information saving and selection of the latest available context at startup
    - implements secured parameters saving in flash memory (integrity monitoring achieved)
    - implements pump running time computing
    - implements pump automation routine
    - implement saving of pump information in flash memory
    - check temperature filter
    - implements new version of Arduino bootstrapper (v1.12.6 and v1.12.7)
    - resolve re-connect issue (add periodic ping + watchdog)
    - controler board installed within the pump cabinet and successfully tested with the hardware

    Next steps:
    - long duration test in the final configuration
    - implements parameters modification through Home-Assistant (started with version 3.3)
    - code cleaning, removal of unnecessary debug code
    Nice to have:
    - multiple SSID selection at startup
